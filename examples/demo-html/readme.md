# Demo HTML App

This demo HTML app contains a `<textarea>`, `<input>`, and `<div>`. You can use this app while exploring how to use the [Grammarly Text Editor SDK](https://developer.grammarly.com/).

## Try the demo

You can try the demo in [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/grammarly/grammarly-for-developers/tree/main/examples/demo-html?file=/public/index.html).

Note that this demo does _not_ contain the code for using the SDK, so Grammarly suggestions will not appear in the app automatically.

## How it works

The app contains three text editors. You can add Grammarly suggestions to the text editors by creating a [new Grammarly for Developers app](https://developer.grammarly.com/apps) and then following the Quick Start instructions for an HTML app.

## Get the code

A copy of this code is available in the [Grammarly for Developers GitHub repo](https://github.com/grammarly/grammarly-for-developers/tree/main/examples/demo-html).
